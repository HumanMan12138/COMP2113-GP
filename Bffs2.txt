Tarnished is thrown into a new room colored with the pigment made of gold. 
Ding......Gold coins drop around Tarnished, when he tries to grab them, they suddenly disappear. 
Verthandi: Ah......Don be fooled by simple tricks and distracted by meaningless stones, tarnished. I'm Verthandi, one of Norns, here to offer you an accord. 
Tarnished: Apologize for my ignorance, my lord, an accord? 
Verthandi: Yes, I see a thread of destiny leads to the future blurred by grey fog, and, You are on it. Thus, I decide to make a small bet on you. We shall play a game and see what should be my pledges.  
Tarnished: Praise your kindness! I'm honored to join this game, my lord.
