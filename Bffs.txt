A Tower stands afront Tarnished, with its spire piercing through the ceiling of the dungeon, and its bottom tailing in the ground. The wall of the tower is in color of taupe, with grains like marks of bites.  
Tarnished walks through the tower's door, and sees a statue with face blurred by deep grey fog.  
Before the first statue, a voice in his head told him to show the respects that a god deserve.  
Tarnished kneels on one knee and waits for the change. 
Unknown: Long time no fearless tarnished dare to challenge the Spirit of mine. What are you looking for, even though you know the price could only be paid once? 
Tarnished: Freedom, my lord. The sweetest thing that I realized once I lost it. 
Unknown: Strange...... You shall be honored for confusing me. However, this little curiosity you brought can't satisfy my spirit. 
Tarnished: What should I do to get your acknowledgement, my lord? 
Unknown: There is one interesting game I found when I travel in Midgard as mortal, named "Blackjack"......You would receive commitment if you perform well in this game. You shall remember, every coins you earned from this game would perform an important role in your future journey. Good luck...... 
Tarnished: Thanks for your generosity, my lord.
