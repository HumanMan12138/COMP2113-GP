Verthandi: I see...... You shall know that the next spirit is from me and my sisters, Norns. It's the last and most difficult challenge, but I could help you to cheat the their eyes. 
Tarnished: But you and your sisters know what shall happen in the past, presence, and future...... Oh...... 
Verthandi: I' m the authority of vart and I can blur their eyes on presence...... When you need me, call my name in your heart and I will be there...... 
Tarnished feels that something broke down, a real world gradually unfolds. The third statue changes and becomes three gods with blurred face and different postures.  
one stands helplessly. 
one knits the shattered web. 
one irrigates the rotten root of the tree.
