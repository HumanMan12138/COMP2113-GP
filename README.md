Introduction
The game of our groups is basically a challenge game. Players need to challenge various passes to win the game. The background of game is from Nordic Mythology, before the Ragnarök, the twilight that Gods will fight against each other and most of them were going to die. Our main character, Tarnished, who is banished in the dungeon under the world tree, is going to challenge the spirits left by gods and demigods to get back his freedom. 
There are a main game and several sub-games that characters will play. 
Firstly, Battleship is known worldwide as a pencil and paper game which dates from World War I. It was published by various companies as a pad-and-pencil game in the 1930s and was released as a plastic board game by Milton Bradley in 1967. The game has spawned electronic versions, video games, smart device apps and a film. We makes a similar game and name it by Battleplane.
Battleplane is played on 10 * 10 board on which the fleet of planes are settled. It is a strategy type guessing game for one player. There are three planes fixed on the board randomly, which do not overlap.(Warmly reminder: They might be really close to each other.)
The player will continuously be asked to call 'shots' by inputting the coordinate of the point they would like to fire at. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the player. Please note that player will be provided only 25 bullets! You will lose if you used up all the bullets.
After shooting, results will be printed out for the player. There will be one or more of these below:

•	Nothing but air: 'You missed!'
•	Some other part of one plane was hit: 'You hit the body!'
•	The head of one plane was shot down:
•	'Good Job! You shot down the plane! There are 2 planes left!'
•	'Great!! You shot down another plane!! There is only 1 plane left!!'
•	'Congratulations!! No plane left, You win!!'

Our objective is to find all the heads of the planes and shoot them down. Once the players have destroyed the fleet, they win that level! Have a look at the plane from four directions:
  *          +++          +            + 
+++++         +           + +        + + 
  +         +++++        *+++        ++++*
 +++          *           + +        + +
                          +            +
Secondly, the game Casino, will simulate two betting strategies: Martingale and d'Alembert. This game includes three functions that allow you to choose which betting strategy to simulate.
The first function, called "casino", allows you to choose between the Martingale and d'Alembert betting strategies. The Martingale strategy is a popular betting system that requires you to double your bet after every loss until you win. The idea is that when you do win, you will recover all of your losses and make a profit equal to your original bet. The d'Alembert strategy, on the other hand, is a more conservative betting system that requires you to increase your bet by one unit after every loss and decrease it by one unit after every win.
