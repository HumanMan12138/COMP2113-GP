Tarnished, who is banished in the dungeon under the Yggdrasil, can't leave unless they challenge the spirits left by demigods. 
Mimir, the wise in Aesir!
Thor, the God of War!
Norns, the Sisters of Fate!
Now, Graceless Tarnished, take your weapons and intrepid heart. Though the roads are with thorns and the journey are meant to be alone, you shall remember: 
There is no Destined Death.
