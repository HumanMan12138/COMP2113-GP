Norns: Alas...We see a new flow from the river of time, an unforeseeable part on the net of destiny...You shall leave here, the world shall change since your first step off the door... 
Tarnished walks to the door, with steps become faster and faster, finally runs off the door.
He sees the nightfall.
He smells the blood of wars.
He stands on the ground going to be covered by corpses.
He howls for regained freedom.
The journey of tarnished doesn't ends, there is obligation and honor on his road.
