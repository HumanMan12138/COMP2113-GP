Before the second statue, Tarnished kneels and waits for the change. 
Unknown: Folly tarnished, emboldened by the flame of ambition, challenging the God of War.
Tarnished: It's grateful that my desire for freedom be claimed as flame by you, my lord. I believe, one day, it can burn the world. 
The God of War: Meaningless talk! The rule is simple by me, if you can win the army of mine by controlling the army I give to you, my commitment would be given. 
Tarnished: You would see the fire, my lord.
