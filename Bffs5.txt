Before the third statue, Tarnished kneels down and waits for the change. 
Unknown: Alas......We see the twilight; all the dignity and honor would fall and the age of dark shall come......Tarnished...Your chase for freedom is meaningless struggle before...the Ragnarok. 
Tarnished remains silent for a while.
Tarnished: Though you might not understand, my lord, die in the dark dungeon, or die running on the land of Asgard, fighting against what was meant to happen, would make a difference for me. 
Norns: Courage shall be the paean of human...We, Norns, the Sisters of Fate, leave some riddles for you...Let's see what destiny tells us about you... 
Tarnished with head raised: Whatever it says, I would not listen to it!
